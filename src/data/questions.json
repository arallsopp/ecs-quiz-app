      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Fire-stopping is a passive fire protection measure used to seal any openings created in a fire resistance-rated wall or floor assembly, e.g. to allow pipes or wiring systems to pass through. During fire conditions this will impede the spread of fire and smoke."

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "During a fire it is essential that the load-bearing capacity of elements of the building structure are maintained until occupants have escaped. Timber studs, joists or 'I' beams, for example, may only have a short survival time if exposed to fire and may rely on linings, such as a plasterboard ceiling, for fire-resistance. Services passing through such linings should therefore be fire-stopped."
